          <h1>GST Charges</h1>

          <p style="text-align: justify">
            As per government rules, we are required to levy GST charges for our
            services. For your clarity, we have provided an explanation and an
            example.<br />
            SGST 9% and CGST 9% = Total GST charge of 18%. This will be charged
            to each of our customers at the end of every month.<br />
            This is a charge of 18% on their service charge for the month.<br />
            E.g. November month total service charge = Rs. 30/-<br />
            Therefore, GST charge = 0.18 X 30 = Rs 5.40/-<br />
